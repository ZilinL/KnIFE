## Introduction

The repository contains the implementation of "Domain Generalization for Zero-calibration BCIs with Knowledge Distillation-based Phase Invariant Feature Extraction", which is currently under review.

alg/algs/Knife.py contains the core code of the proposed method, which includes the realization of knowledge distillation framework, Correlation alignment, and spectrum transfer.
